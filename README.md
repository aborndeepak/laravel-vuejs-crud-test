==================

Create a REST API to model sports teams and their players. Also create a U/I to show functionality.

Be sure to include the following elements:

* migration for adding the teams table
* migration for adding the players table
* seed script to fill the tables with some data
* API endpoint to add a team
* API endpoint to add a player
* API endpoint to update a player
* API endpoint to get a team and its players
* Bonus: authentication method so only trusted entities may call the APIs

Schema for teams table (you may add additional fields as needed):

* id
* name
* created_at
* updated_at

Schema for players table (you may add additional fields as needed):

* id
* first_name
* last_name
* created_at
* updated_at
